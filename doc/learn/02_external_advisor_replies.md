# Replies to external AI advisors (claude.ai & perplexity.ai)

Context: on 2026-09-11 the golden dataset suite was reviewed by two external AI
advisors. Per house rule **"external reviews are checkpoints, not verdicts"**,
every claim they made was verified against the actual repo before adoption.
This file holds the replies we sent back, the verification evidence behind
them, and what was adopted vs declined (registered as D17–D19).

## What was adopted vs declined (evidence)

| Advisor claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Doc = method manual, not data source | **Adopted** → guide §1 Scope-boundary note | `01_golden_dataset_authoring.md` §1 |
| Examples need verbatim grounding | **Confirmed as already-true** | lines cited above, `grep -n` verified |
| Judgment layer "not automatable" | **Refined**: scripts don't automate it; LLM *can* do it carefully | FAQ `:377-382` |
| D16 lane (authoring = `data`/`tester`; learner = NB-01) | **Confirmed** | `doc/DECISIONS.md:26` |
| toy-corpus sandbox for practice | **Adopted** → registered D19 | `doc/DECISIONS.md` D19 |
| "Draft 3–5 rows into committed goldens" | **Declined** — closed set + lane | D19, D16 |

## Registered decisions (D17–D19)

- **D17** — External AI advisors' claims are external reviews = checkpoints;
  verified against the repo before adoption; adopted claims fold into docs.
- **D18** — `tools/goldens/*.py` is build tooling for eval data (idempotent,
  portable, zero hardcoded paths) — agent-maintainable, committed in-repo.
- **D19** — Committed golden set is closed at 139/67/107; new rows only via a
  registered gap; practice goldens live in a toy sandbox outside
  `eval/goldens/`.

**Verdict (repo-verified):** fully conceded and consistent with the guide.
Two factual claims checked:
- The FAQ quote it attributes (`guide:377-382`) is accurate: "No. The
  authoring is you reading and writing; the scripts only extract and assert."
- "313 rows" = 139 + 67 + 107 ✓ (verified against the three golden files).

**Our outcome:** adoption is already complete — the guide's §1 scope note and
the three-layer framing in §1 already say exactly what claude.ai converged
on. No further doc change needed; this round only re-verified and closed the
loop. If a future round proposes changing the guide's FAQ from "Do I need an
LLM? No." to a softer claim, the D17 record is the evidence that the current
phrasing was already the agreed one.
